# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this 
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `ProgressBar` control for tracking the completion of a task with automatic value conversions
- `enable()` and `disable()` methods on all controls
- `RadioButtons` control for groups of radio buttons
- `Combobox::selected()` method to retrieve the currently selected index of the combobox
- Officially move communications to the Matrix room #rust-native-ui:matrix.nora.codes
* `str_tools` module provides utilities for converting to and from system `CString` and
`CStr` values, while enforcing correct newline values (CR vs CRLF).

### Changed

* `ui-sys` is now built with Bindgen. This means it can track libui more closely.
* README.md now links to libui, and is more explanatory
* `LayoutGrid::insert_at` no longer takes `left` and `height` arguments
* Many APIs which took `u64` or `i64` arguments now take `i32` for wider compatibility
* The semi-unstable `iui::draw` subsystem is again exported to downstream consumers of the `iui` crate.
* `UI::queue_main` and `UI::on_should_quit` now require passed closures to be `'static`, for soundness
* All callback registration functions require that their callbacks live at least as long as the `UI` token, for soundness
* `Menu` methods now returns `Option<>` because menus can't always be created or
modified

### Deprecated

No deprecations.

### Removed

* `Transform` no longer implements `PartialEq` as the existing implementation was broken.
* `Button` and `Label` no longer implement `text_ref` as we cannot ensure toolkit newline
compliance.

### Fixed

* `VerticalBox` and `HorizontalBox` no longer link to the removed `BoxExt` trait.
* `ui-sys` now builds on modern macOS.
* `inputs` and `inputs-grid` examples no longer erroneously start at 0 for inputs starting at 1.
* Text no longer uses incorrect newlines per platform.
* `UI::run_delay` no longer spins on the callback, but actually calls it at the
appropriate interval
* Menus can no longer be created or modified after windows, as this causes crashes.

### Security

No security changes.

- README now has syntax coloring

- `Checkbox` control for Boolean input

- `LayoutGrid` control for grid-based 2D layouts
- `ui-sys` can now be built without either pulling or building `libui`, controlled by Cargo features 
- Building on MSVC now works

### Changed

- `ptr()` method on controls is no longer `unsafe`
- `iui` now uses `bitflags` 1.0
- `Area` functions which have UB based on the type of `Area` are now `unsafe`
