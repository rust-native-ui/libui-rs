## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

* README.md now links to libui, and is more explanatory
* `LayoutGrid::insert_at` no longer takes `left` and `height` arguments
* Many APIs which took `u64` or `i64` arguments now take `i32` for wider compatibility
* The semi-unstable `iui::draw` subsystem is again exported to downstream consumers of the `iui` crate.

### Deprecated

No deprecations.

### Removed

* `Transform` no longer implements `PartialEq` as the existing implementation was broken.

### Fixed

* `VerticalBox` and `HorizontalBox` no longer link to the removed `BoxExt` trait.
* `ui-sys` now builds on modern macOS.

### Security

No security changes.
